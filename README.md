# GodoPy
[Python](https://www.python.org) scripting for the [Godot game engine](http://godotengine.org),
[Cython](https://cython.org) and Python bindings to the Godot script API.

## Work in progress
This project is a work in progress.

Initial proof-of-concept bindings are in the [proof-of-concept](https://github.com/godopy/godopy/tree/proof-of-concept) branch. Note that the old branch is a fork of [godot-cpp](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp) and has a separate git history and is not compatible with other branches.

This is a clean implementation in the early stages of development.
